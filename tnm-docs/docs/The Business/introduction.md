# About The Business

The Nutritionist Manchester is a local meal prep business serving the Manchester area. The business cooks between 3-12 meals for anything between 50 to 100 clients twice a week.

Meal recipes are sourced from the imagination of our founder, Ryan Walker, and cooked by a team of talented chefs. The business operates using an automatic plan generation application that provides the business with the flexibility to offer clients customisation on top of the meals the business selects for them. Customers also have the ability to log into the system themselves and select the meals they wish to receive that week.
