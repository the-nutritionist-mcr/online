# Customisations

The core of this application is build around the concept of 'customisations'. These are simple tags which can apply to both [recipes](./recipes.md) and [customers](./customers.md). When generating a [plan](../Features/meal-plan-generation.md) when a customer is to be supplied with a recipe that includes a tag also attached to a customer, this is highlighted in a number of places

- On the meal [label](../Features/labels.md) - so the customer is confidence their food is correct
- On the cook plan - so the kitchen always cook the correct meal
- On the pack plan - so the correct meal is delivered to the customer

This page is a simple [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) database of all the tags that _can_ be applied
