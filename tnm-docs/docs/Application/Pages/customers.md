## Edit Customer

If you click on the customer name, the edit customer page **does** however allow you to

1. Reset a customer's password (which automatically sends out a new welcome email)
2. Edit what [customisation](../Pages/customisations.md) tags are associated with a given customer
3. Apply a 'custom plan' to a customer (by changing the meal distribution)
