# Customers

:::info
This page is **not customer facing**
:::

The customers page provides a **partially read only** view of the customers available in our ChargeBee site. **customer details** such as address, name and telephone number are all managed in ChargeBee. 

The portal **does** however allow you to 

- Edit what customisation tags are associated with a given customer
- Apply a 'custom plan' to a customer
- Reset a customer's password (which automatically sends out a new welcome email)
