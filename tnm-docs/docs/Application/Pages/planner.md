The planner provides a _staging area for the weekly cook plan_ that allows staff members to

- View the generated cook plan
- Make changes to the cook plan to cater for individual preferences
- Publish the plan for customers (taking into account the rules that govern [whether the plan is actually open or closed](../Faq/is-the-plan-open-or-closed.md)) so that customers can submit their choices using the [choose meals](../Pages/choose-meals.md) page
- Download the [cook plan](../Features/cook-plan.md), [pack plan](../Features/pack-plan.md) and [meal labels](../Features/labels.md)
